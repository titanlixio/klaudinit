# CVM Simple Example [WIP]

The count parameter on resources can simplify configurations
and let you scale resources by simply incrementing a number.

Additionally, variables can be used to expand a list of resources
for use elsewhere.

To run, configure your Tencent Cloud provider as described in https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/tencentcloud/index.html

Running the example

run `terraform apply` to see it work.
